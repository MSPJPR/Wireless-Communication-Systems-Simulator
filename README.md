The Wireless Communication Systems Simulator is a web-based interactive tool designed to simulate the characteristics and behaviors of wireless communication systems. It helps users understand key concepts like channel fading, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by providing dynamic visualizations and simulations. This tool is designed to enhance learning in wireless communication, making it easier for students and professionals to experiment with and observe the effects of various parameters on wireless system performance.

Key Features:

1. Wireless Channel Simulation:

Simulate the behavior of wireless channels under different conditions.

Parameters include Frequency (GHz), Bandwidth (MHz), and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB).

Simulate Rayleigh Fading and observe its impact on the channel.

Display time and frequency coherence, and channel uncertainty.



2. MIMO Simulation:

Simulate MIMO communication for both uplink and downlink.

Provides insights into Space-Time-Frequency Diversity.

Allows users to understand the effects of multiple antennas in improving the signal quality and data rate.



3. Interactive Sliders:

Real-time adjustment of key parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, and SNR using sliders.

Immediate feedback on how changes to these parameters affect system performance.



4. Dynamic Output:

Display real-time results of simulations, including details about channel model, SNR, bandwidth, and other important metrics.

Interactive and user-friendly output area that updates dynamically.




Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

User Interface: Responsive and clean design with interactive elements like sliders and buttons for parameter adjustments.

No backend required: This is a front-end only application suitable for mobile and desktop use.


Use Cases:
